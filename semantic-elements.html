<h2> Puppies are cute </h2>
  <p> We bought <strong>2 boxer puppies </strong> back in October. I got puppies <u>instead of a new truck</u>. <br> They are brother sister, and the cutest puppies ever! They have <em> such </em> big personalities!  </p>
  <h3><small> Cats aren't so bad </small></h3>
<p> I am trying to get my step daughter to adopt a kitty to take to her moms house. <br> I don't like cats very much.
  <q>I had a kitten pee on me when I was super young and decided they aren't my cup of tea. </q> </p>
<h4> Conclusion </h4>
<p> Our boxer puppies are turning 5 months old January 18th. </p> <blockquote> I love coming home to my puppies!</blockquote>
